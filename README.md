Slug-O-Lympics, Mechatronics Project (Team size: 3)                                                                                
-	Winners of Slug-O-Lympics competition.
-	Designed an autonomous robot that can navigate through a predetermined field, avoid obstacles, detect and load ping pong balls from loading tower, scan the field for target towers and drop the balls near them.
-	The bot was built around UNO 32 using Dc motors, tape sensors, beacon and track wire detectors.
-	Used solidworks to build the bot, designed and built all the electronic circuits for the bot,developed state machines for various events
